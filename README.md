Problem Statement
Managing student records manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Educational institutions need a simple system to store, view, and manage basic student details such as roll number, name, department, and marks.
The problem is to design a Java-based GUI application that allows users to:
-Enter student details
-Store them in memory
-View all saved records easily
-Handle input errors properly
-Demonstrate core Java concepts like OOP, multithreading, and event handling.
Objective
·  Allows the user to add student records.
·  Displays all stored student information.
·  Uses Object-Oriented Programming (abstraction, inheritance).
·  Implements multithreading for background operations.
·  Provides a user-friendly graphical interface.
·  Handles runtime errors using exception handling.
